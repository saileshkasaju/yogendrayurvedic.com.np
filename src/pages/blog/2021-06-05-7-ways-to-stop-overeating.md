* Food nourishes the body and love nourishes the soul.
* When you are with a loving friend or close family member you can become so happy that you forget to eat.
* You feel no need for food at that time because you receive a higher food-love.
* But when a person doesn't receive that love or feel that happiness he or she becomes lonely or has a feeling of rejection or of not being loved.
* Food may become the substitute for love.
