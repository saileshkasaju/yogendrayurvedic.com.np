The effectiveness of your digestion depends on the strength of your digestive fire Agni.

* If your food intake is large in quantity and heavy, very liquid, or quite dense in quality, these properties are antagonistic to the properties of gastric fire and can slow the normal function of the Agni leading to indigestion.

* Emotional eating-eating for emotional reason when the system is not in need of food or is given too much to comfortably digest is another potential cause of indigestion.

* Third major causative factor is wrong food combining. Eating Bananas and milk melon and grain and other incompatible food combinations adversely affect the digestive fire leading to indigestion.

* These various factors promote excess secretion of acid leading to acid indigestion, heartburn, nausea or even diarrhea; fomentation of the food in the stomach or intestine may also occur leading to gas bloating and a possible stomach ache, depending on the severity of the cause.
